## Files
aliases - useful aliases for enabling things like proxy and default AWS profile
gitexcludes - only has .DS_Store, so you don't have to add that line to *every* .gitignore
quickSetup.sh - Run on a blank machine to install our baseline apps. **Note: Must be run from within this repository!**
